# Dansplants

A program to keep track of all your houseplants.

## Requirements

You must have python3 installed. I have only tested on Windows so far, although it should be cross-platform.

## Usage

Launch the GUI by running `dansplants.bat` (if on Windows) or by running `python gui.py`. The GUI allows you to view information about your plants, record waterings and fertilizings, and view watering and fertilizing histories for your plants.

Go to `File -> Configure Plants` to open the plant configuration window. Here you can add plants to be tracked, and edit or archive existing plants. Archiving a plant will remove it from view but keep its data in local storage. The ability to view and interact with the archive is coming soon.

There is also an interactive command-line interface which you can launch with `python cli.py`. It is not very user-friendly and does not have much of a purpose.
